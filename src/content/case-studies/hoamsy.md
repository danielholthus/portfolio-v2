    title: 'Messenger',
    description: "On this project, I was in charge of incorporating a rich text editor into Hoamsy’s native messaging component. ‍The goal was to allow users to be able to send and receive links from one another, as well as format their text if they chose to do so, and I was able to accomplish this goal by ultilizing a 3rd party rich text editor plugin and integrating it into the preexisting component.",
